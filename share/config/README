This is the application directory for a BenchmarkAnything storage,
see http://benchmarkanything.org for more info.

By default it contains an SQLite database containing benchmark results
and config files for different situations:

* For a distributed client/server configuration, point your tools to
  use the 'client.cfg' by setting the environment variable in your
  ~/.bash_profile:

    export BENCHMARKANYTHING_CONFIGFILE=[% CLIENTCFG %]

  and your server environment to use the 'server,cfg' by setting the
  environment variable ONLY in the web server environment:

    export BENCHMARKANYTHING_CONFIGFILE=[% SERVERCFG %]

* For a single-host environment where everything contacts the database
  locally (tools and the HTTP frontend), set this environment variable
  in your ~/.bash_profile:

    export BENCHMARKANYTHING_CONFIGFILE=[% LOCALCFG %]

  which is also the built-in default. This config file also works for
  frontend http server, so if you want to use remote clients later,
  you only need to give them a client config pointing the http
  base_url to this host here.
